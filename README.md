Through developing this project, we discovered the importance of tests. We struggled with SEGFAULTs and other critical
errors due to memory mismanagement during runtime. However, through the efficient use of tests and debugging tools
available (built in debugger + valgrind for memory leaks), we were able to resolve the issue.
